# Del popolo
 This website was built for a food truck in Orlando Florida. The website features information about the food truck, its menu, and services. The site was created to intuitively fill the needs of information seeking customers with an intriguing, clean design. Providing them with location, contact information, catering information, and upcoming events.

### Wireframes
I have provided an active link to my Wireframes https://balsamiq.cloud/skdo9v9/plj57xm
Wireframes were used to assist in the creation of my site. They played a key role throughout it's development. The Wireframes helped make the responsive design as well as the nav-bar that was used throughout the site on each of the pages. 

 


## Features
 
### Existing Features
- Responsive design: Allows for the viewing of the site on small, medium, and large devices.

## Technologies Used

In this section, you should mention all of the languages, frameworks, libraries, and any other tools that you have used to construct this project. For each, provide its name, a link to its official site and a short sentence of why it was used.

- [Bootstrap](https://Bootstrap.com)
    - The project uses **Bootstrap** to To help me create the grid layout, header, and Nav-Bar. I used Bootstrap 4 (therefore I used Popper and jQuery that comes with it).

- [Google Fonts](https://Googlefonts.com)
    - The project uses **Google Fonts** I used two fonts from this source. PLayfair and Roboto, by only using two sources it helped my site to appear more uniformed throughout.

- [code Institute](https://codeinstitute.com)
    - The project refrenced what I have learned in **Mini projects from Code Institute**, I refrenced two techniques. One was from the Whiskey Landing Page, I used the picture rounding technique from the reviews. However I did make the code my own customizing the display positionings, colors, pictures, bootstrap etc. The second technique that I refrenced was from the Love Running Project. I used the location and times section with the Opaque overlay of the picture. However this code was made my own by customizing nearly aspect of it in order for it to work in my Bootsrap system. 

- [CodePen]//codepen.io/scanfcode/pen/MEZPNd)
    - The project uses **Code Pen** I used a footer template from this site that is used at the bottom of every page on the site. I made the code my own by through customization. I made it so that it is responsive in Bootstrap, changed the background color, font color, content, css hover, and layout. 
    
 - [Font Awesome](https://Fontaesome.com)
    - The project uses **Font Awesome**. All of the social media Icons in the footer are from Font Awesome).
    
 - [Bootstrap](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUXdZuw_KP8)
    - The project uses **Bootstrap** to create the form on the contact page. "How to Create Forms Using Bootstrap" Video found on youtube.).


    
    
## Testing
The first step in the process of testing my code was to use online W3C Validators for both HTML and CSS. Once the code was able to pass both of these validators without errors, I moved on to the next phase of testing. The second testing phase was done as that fron a users. As a user I went through the entire site and tested all of my internal and external links, tested images, hover options, social media links, and responsiveness. 
* As a user I was able to easily obtain a menu.
* As a customer I was able to find their current location as well as location of upcoming events.
* As a user I was a able to establish a direct line of communication in order to discuss tailored catering options.
