## Technologies Used

- [Bootstrap](https://Bootstrap.com)
    - The project uses **Bootstrap** to help me create the grid layout, header, Nav-Bar, and contact form. I used Bootstrap 4 (therefore I used Popper and jQuery that comes with it).

- [Google Fonts](https://Googlefonts.com)
    - The project uses **Google Fonts** I used 'Dosis' from Google Fonts, by only using one font it helped my site to appear more uniformed throughout.

- [code Institute](https://codeinstitute.com)
    - The project referenced what I have learned in **Mini projects from Code Institute**, I referenced three techniques. One was from the Whiskey Landing Page, as well as the picture rounding technique from the reviews. However I did make the code my own customizing the display positionings, colors, pictures, bootstrap, etc. The second technique that I referenced was from the Love Running Project. I used the location and times section with the Opaque overlay of the picture. However this code was made my own by customizing nearly aspect of it for it to work in my Bootstrap system. 

- [CodePen]//codepen.io/scanfcode/pen/MEZPNd)
    - The project uses **Code Pen** I used a footer template from this site that is used at the bottom of every page on the site. I made the code my own through customization. I made it so that it is responsive in Bootstrap, changed the background color, font color, content, CSS hover, and layout. 
    
 - [Font Awesome](https://Fontaesome.com)
    - The project uses **Font Awesome**. All of the social media icons in the footer are from Font Awesome).
    
 - [Bootstrap](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUXdZuw_KP8)
    - The project uses **Bootstrap** to create the form on the contact page. "How to Create Forms Using Bootstrap" Video found on youtube.).
    
 - [W3 Schools]//https://www.w3schools.com/)
    - The project uses **W3 Schools** I used link hover effects and .card transparent overlays on the events page from this source.
